<div id="True 4k Projector">
    <h3>True 4k Projector</h3>
    <p>The <em>True 4k Projector</em> is a projector that is made by DIY Perks(Youtube Channel) that will be used
        to project anything that can be connected via HDMI cable. This is the first major project I plan on completing
        in the near future.</p>

</div>

<div id="Realistic Artificial Daylight Screen">
    <h3>Realistic Artificial Daylight Screen</h3>
    <p>The <em>Realistic Artificial Daylight Screen</em> is a screen that uses the light board from a broken
        tv or monitor that produces light that looks very similar to daylight. This screen can be used in the
        middle of the night which it also can improve productivity and it's great for taking pictures.
        This is another project made by DIY Perks.</p>

</div>

<div id="Smart Mirror That Doesn't Steam Up">
    <h3>Smart Mirror That Doesn't Steam Up</h3>
    <p>The <em>Smart Mirror</em> is a smart mirror that doesn't steam up with the use of water circulating
        behind the front screen of the mirror. It can be customized to display whatever information is wanted and can play
        music and videos. Another project by DIY Perks</p>

</div>

<div id="Vacuum Chamber">
    <h3>Vacuum Chamber</h3>
    <p>The <em>Vacuum Chamber</em> is something that can be used to test items inside the chamber. The chamber was made
        by the late creator for the Youtube channel: The King of Random. Grant Thompson made the original design using a type
        of rubber/putty that is used to create the seal for the chamber. After the unfortunate passing of Grant, his mentors
        took over the channel and have been running the channel ever since. I will be using both Grant and NightHawkInLight's
        design for the vacuum chamber.</p>

</div>

<div id="Sand Blaster">
    <h3>Sand Blaster</h3>
    <p>The <em>Sand Blaster</em> is used to sand blast at various items and can be used for different purposes.
        This project was made by DIY Perks and NightHawkInLight, both channels didn't collaborate and I'm adding on to
        both of their designs.</p>

<div id="Touchscreen Smart Mirror With Face ID">
    <h3>Touchscreen Smart Mirror With Face ID</h3>
    <p>The <em>Smart touchscreen mirror</em> is a mirror like the smart mirror that doesn't steam up except it has face ID.
        The design is by Eben Kouao.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWjvJq4Zabk&t=13s" target="_blank">Video of the mirror</a></h4>

</div>

<div id="Smart CCTV Camera">
    <h3>Smart CCTV Camera</h3>
    <p>The <em>Smart CCTV camera</em> is a camera that can be remotely controlled using an app and an interface to move
        the line of sight of the camera. The camera feed is live streamed and can be recorded. The camera's app can send
        notifications to the users phone. This is made be Eben Kouao.</p>

</div>

<div id="Electric Skateboard">
    <h3>Electric Skateboard</h3>
    <p>A <em>electric skateboard</em> is one thats speed can be controlled using a radio controller operated by the user.
        These custom electric skateboards greatly exceed the highest performing commercially available electric skateboards.
        I will be using designs from random88ish and GreatScott!</p>

</div>

<div id="VR Headset">
    <h3>VR Headset</h3>
    <p>The <em>VR headset</em> is a DIY headset made for half the cost that can play many games that support
        Oculous, HTC Vive, or Sony headsets. The DIY headset will have 110 FOV with clear lenses and other displays
        on the outer body of the headset. The headset doesn't require and sensors to accurately show the user in any game.
        This design is made by Raspaholic Ind.</p>
</div>

<div id="Haptic VR Gloves">
    <h3>Haptic VR Gloves</h3>
    <p>Because of the cost of <em>haptic VR gloves</em>, I will be making my own using the design by Lucas VRTech.
        Lucas's design uses potentiometers and badge pulleys to map the distance of the users fingers contracting and the
        movement of the hand. These gloves will work hand in hand with the DIY VR headset and can play many games that
        hand movement like Half Life Alex. The gloves also have a joystick at the top of the assembly for movement of the
        user.</p>

</div>

<div id="Pinball Machine">
    <h3>Pinball Machine</h3>
    <p>The <em>pinball machine</em> design I will be using is from multiple schematics of manufactured pinball
        machines. I'm still trying to find the theme I'll be using but as of now, I have none. Star Wars is a possible
        for the theme of the machine.</p>
</div>

<div id="CNC Machine">
    <h3>CNC Machine</h3>
    <p>The design for the <em>CNC machine</em> is from the youtuber Mikodem Bartnik. His design can easily be made
        from 3d printed parts and other accessible pieces for the machine.</p>

<div id="Rocketry">
    <h3>Rocketry</h3>
    <p></p>
</div>

<div id="Wood Gasifier">
    <h3>Wood Gasifier</h3>
    <p>The design for the <em>wood gasifier</em> is from the youtube channel NightHawkInLight. His design is
        easily configurable to any needs and restrictions of space. The gasifier also can store the gas in a well tested
        canister that is not prone to explosions or any incidents related to that.</p>

</div>

<div id="Forge">
    <h3>Forge</h3>
    <p>The design for the <em>forge</em> is my own design with other aspects of other designs for forges. I plan on
        welding the outer body of the forge in the future when I have a welder.</p>
</div>

<div id="Starlite">
    <h3>Starlite</h3>
    <p><em>Starlite</em> is a material that's recipe was lost due to  the creator having very strict rules over the
        material. Fortunately NightHawkInLight has made his own recipe that is being improved continuosly to better
        compare to the original material. Starlite is a material that acts as a heat shield on rockets. The material
        forms a wall of carbon when burned further pushing the heat source away from the material.</p>

</div>

<div id="Haptic VR Vest">
    <h3>Haptic VR Vest</h3>
    <p>The design for the <em>haptic VR vest</em> is from the youtube channel Pointlessly Useful. His design consists
        of using motors for vibration from controlors like xbox or playstation.</p>

</div>

<div id="Arcade Machine">
    <h3>Arcade Machine</h3>
    <p>The design for the <em>arcade machine</em> is made by the youtube channel I Like To Make Stuff. He has designs
        for both a barstool and upright arcade machine cabinet. My design will be improvising off these two by creating
        an arcade machine cabinet that can be a barstool or normal arcade machine cabinet.</p>

</div>

<div id="Hybrid go-kart">
    <h3>Hybrid go-kart</h3>
    <p>The design for the <em>hybrid go-kart</em> is one of my own designs for the chassis of the car, the frame, and
    look. It will even feature a cup holder.</p>
